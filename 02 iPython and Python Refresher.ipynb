Values are assigned (in fact, objects are bound to names) with the _equals_ sign (\"=\"), and equality testing is done using two _equals_ signs (\"==\"). You can increment/decrement values using the += and -= operators respectively by the right-hand amount. This works on many datatypes, strings included. You can also use multiple variables on one line. \n",
